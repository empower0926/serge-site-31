This early learning of leverage finance, bridging loans, family and friends based crowd funding and various financing instruments was priceless for many assets and investment held thereafter.

                        innovative, often provocative and very nonconventional.

                    <p>
                        His early natural DNA based entrepreneurship started at his birthplace in Kenya at the age of
                        12, selling toys made by himself at his father’s steel factory and repairing strings on tennis,
                        squash and badminton rackets, as he played various sports at the county level. At the age of 15,
                        his parents left Africa to relocate to UK, for the purposes of children’s education. He settled
                        very quickly into the new environment in difficult times, where his sports brilliance and
                        education excellence helped to progress fast.

                    <p>
                        His constant search for the high life made him work at several jobs during any vacation and
                        weekends, always selling gadgets, electronic goods, Hifi and even working night shift at a
                        factory to support his passion for travel, music and the high life during his colourful teenage
                        life. Following his Degree in Computer Studies, his first property investment within 6 months
                        was a 2 bed apartment and a mini supermarket, which he managed and ran part time. His
                        entrepreneur passion grew from here, whilst doing 2 jobs in parallel.

                        specialist and project management of major multimillion dollar clients in Finance, Banking and
                        Public Sector to Retail, Travel and Hospitality, through to sales and business sector management

                        He is a self-made serial entrepreneur who has had a fair share of wins and losses. Having
                        self-made and lost millions during 3 crises, he has a unique story and lessons in all aspects of
                        life, having risen from the Ashes like a Phoenix, wiser and braver. It is that experience, as
                        well as frustration, that drove him to start a blockchain based ecosystem, to disrupt the
                        banking and wealth management market by removing most of the middlemen that have in the past
                        taken advantage of the weak and desperate investors with extremely high charges. Since 2016, Mru
                        has been actively building his vision of “be your own wealth and bank manager” through a wealth
                        management platform that incorporates multi-currency trading, digital banking, exchange, card
                        services, AI/ML based trading system, as well as providing solutions for “financial inclusion
                        and beyond” in the decentralised market.
